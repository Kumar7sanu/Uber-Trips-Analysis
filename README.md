# **Uber-Trips-Analysis**
Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed using Python - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries

## **Project Description:**

In this project, I used Python to analyze Uber trips data to gain insights into ride patterns and user behavior. The Uber dataset used in this project contains information about over 4 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014.

## Project Goals:

Cleaning the Uber trips data to remove missing values and irrelevant information.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of pickups, drop-offs, and ride duration.
Identifying peak hours for Uber pickups and drop-offs.
Analyzing the demand-supply gap of Uber rides during peak hours.
Identifying the most popular pickup and drop-off locations.
Visualizing the Uber trip data using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Project Steps:

###Data Collection: Collecting the Uber trips dataset from a reliable source.

###Data Cleaning: Cleaning the dataset to remove missing values and irrelevant columns.

###Data Analysis: Analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends in the data. This step will include exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Peak Hours Analysis: Identifying the peak hours for Uber pickups and drop-offs using visualizations and statistical analysis.

Demand-Supply Gap Analysis: Analyzing the demand-supply gap of Uber rides during peak hours using Python.

Popular Locations Analysis: Identifying the most popular pickup and drop-off locations using visualization and data analysis techniques.

Visualizations: Creating visualizations using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent the analysis results.

Conclusion: Summarizing the insights gained from the analysis and making recommendations to Uber based on the findings.

Project Deliverables:

A detailed report on the Uber Trips Analysis using Python.
Python code for the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Visualizations of the analysis results.
Recommendations to Uber based on the analysis findings.
Project Timeline:

Week 1: Data collection and cleaning
Week 2: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identifying peak hours
Week 3: Demand-supply gap analysis and popular locations analysis
